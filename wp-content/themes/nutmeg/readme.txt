== Description ==

Nutmeg is a free WordPress theme for food blogs and food recipe websites. It is mobile friendly (responsive) and easy to use.
Nutmeg was built for the WordPress Block Editor (Gutenberg) and includes several custom Block Patterns. This is one of the reasons why it does not require plugins like Elementor, Visual Composer, Beaver Builder or any other page building plugins. 
It is compatible with popular WordPress recipe plugins like WP Recipe Maker, Recipe Card Blocks, Delicious Recipes, etc. 
Thanks to its small size and fast loading speeds, Nutmeg can easily achieve high scores in Google's Web Vitals pagespeed tests.
Inspired by popular themes like Foodie Pro, Soledad, Sitka, Rosemary, Foodica and Yummy Recipe, Nutmeg aims to become a worthy alternative. 
It can be easily used on WordPress websites about other topics too, such as travel, lifestyle, beauty, fashion, product reviews, etc.
